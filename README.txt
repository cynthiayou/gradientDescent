Part 1: 
Implement the following five algorithms to train a linear regression model for the Boston housing data set:
Report the root mean squared errors (RMSE) on the training and testing sets.
1. The gradient descent algorithm
2. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm
3. The SGD algorithm with momentum
4. The SGD algorithm with Nesterov momentum
5. The AdaGrad algorithm

how to run (for linear regression):
    python gradient_descent_for_linear_regression.py

Output:
There will be 1 output file that contains the results of the 5 different gradient descent algorithms:
 'linear_reg_result.txt'
